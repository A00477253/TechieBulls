Hello, myself Pranay Malusare. I am from Pune, Maharashtra the land of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. I was born and brought up in Pune, after completing high school in the science field I decided to take a new career leap into to engineering department in the year 2019. As IT industry was booming at that time and my extensive curiosity in the computer field made me choose *Information Technology* for my engineering bachelor's degree.  I graduated with an astonishing CGPA of 8.7 in 2023. I decided not to take a pause and start my professional work journey immediately, I chose to continue my education path and was admitted for my master's degree in Computing and Data Analytics at Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Canada. I arrived in Canada on 21st August 2023, and it has been a beautiful journey so far.

Being a fresher and having no white-collar world experience it might be hard for me to start from scratch in a very new country but this is the challenge I am willing to take, I am happy I chose this path of master's as soon as I graduated. 

##### I am looking for endless opportunities, possibilities, problems, and solutions to the very same in the coming future
